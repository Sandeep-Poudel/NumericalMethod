## Introduction

In this project, we implement the bisection and secant methods to solve non-linear equations. These methods are commonly used in numerical analysis to find the roots of equations.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can download and install a suitable compiler such as GCC or Clang.

## Usage

To use the bisection and secant methods, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the source code using the C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable file generated.

## Examples
